# Population Activity of Mossy Fibre Axon Input to the Cerebellar Cortex during behaviours

## Summary

This repository contains data processing and analysis code for the research article:

**Population activity of mossy fibre axon input to the cerebellar cortex during behaviours**

We used an AOL microscope to image mossy fibre axons in a 3D imaging volume in the cerebellar cortex of behaving mice. Our aim was to examine how MF populations represent different behavioural states and sensorimotor variables. In addition, we characterized the manifold structure and dimensionality of these representations. Please cite our paper above if you use this code in your research.

## Structure

- **./Analysis**: Analysis code for the main figures and supplementary materials.
- **./Init**: Path settings and laser timing adjustments.
- **./preprocessing**: Contains code for LDR, smoothing, and axon grouping. Processed index, correlation, and GC model data used for the main analysis are also included.
